# Quotes Repository

This repository contains a large collection of over 1500 inspiring, motivational, and thought-provoking quotes, stored in a well-structured JSON file. Each quote is paired with the author’s name, making it easy to display random quotes along with their attribution. The quotes cover a wide range of topics, including success, life, perseverance, and more—making it a great resource for web applications, websites, or personal projects that aim to inspire and motivate users.

The JSON format is simple and easy to parse, making it perfect for developers to quickly integrate quotes into their applications. Whether you're building a quote generator, a daily inspiration tool, or just looking for a way to add meaningful content to your project, this repository has you covered.

Feel free to use, modify, or integrate this file into your personal or commercial projects. You are welcome to fork the repository, contribute additional quotes, or make improvements to suit your needs.

## JSON Structure

The JSON file stores each quote as an object with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "Author": "Thomas Edison",
    "Quote": "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."
  },
  {
    "Author": "Yogi Berra",
    "Quote": "You can observe a lot just by watching."
  },
  {
    "Author": "Abraham Lincoln",
    "Quote": "A house divided against itself cannot stand."
  }
]
```

Each object contains:
- `Author`: The person who said the quote.
- `Quote`: The actual quote.

## Accessing Quotes

To fetch a random quote from the JSON file, you can use the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
// URL to the JSON file (replace with your actual file URL)
const quotesurl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mayborg121/QuotesFileHostin/refs/heads/main/quotes.json';

// Fetch the JSON data
fetch(quotesurl)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Handle the JSON data here
        const quotes = data[Math.floor(Math.random() * data.length)];
        setquote(quotes);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching JSON:', error);
    });
```

This code:
1. Fetches the JSON data from the URL.
2. Randomly selects a quote.
3. Displays the selected quote by calling the `setquote()` function (you should define this function to display the quote on your webpage).
